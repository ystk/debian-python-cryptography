Random number generation
========================

When generating random data for use in cryptographic operations, such as an
initialization vector for encryption in
:class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes.CBC` mode, you do not
want to use the standard :mod:`random` module APIs. This is because they do not
provide a cryptographically secure random number generator, which can result in
major security issues depending on the algorithms in use.

Therefore, it is our recommendation to `always use your operating system's
provided random number generator`_, which is available as ``os.urandom()``. For
example, if you need 16 bytes of random data for an initialization vector, you
can obtain them with:

.. doctest::

    >>> import os
    >>> iv = os.urandom(16)
